TODO
====

[ ] unit tests
    - via web server
    - standalone test application

[ ] D-Bus structs
    - There are no structs in JSON. Maybe an array and the type from the
      parameter signature.

[ ] D-Bus signals
    - bridge need to save a state for each client
    - attach received signals to the state
    - client can fetch signals with a special call (?)
    - how to avoid denial of service issues?

[ ] D-Bus dictionaries with non-string keys
